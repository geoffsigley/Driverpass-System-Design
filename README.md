# Driverpass-System-Design

#Driverpass is looking to close the gap for new drivers. They want help creating an application that will give new students tools to help them pass their driving exam. These include things such as scheduling appointments to drive with an instructor, online exams, and practice tests

#I Did pretty well in making my UML diagrams.

#I wouldn't personally revise much on this project. I'm really happy with what I've brought to this.

#I interpreted the user's need while also making sure they work with the requirements of Driverpass(client). It important to consider the user needs because they will be the ones that will use the application the most. We want to make sure the user is satisfied with the service and make them feel confident in our work.

#I approached designing software by creating a simple interface for the desired functionality that is clear and easy to use. Create a test program that can test this interface. Once the interface and the test program are both ready, build a prototype, a program that has only the minimal features you want, but which still is functional. This is important because now you can actually use your interface and test your prototype.
